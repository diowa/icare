==============

**icare** is an open source [carpooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool) platform.

Carpooling (also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage), is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car.
By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each personâ€™s travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods and high fuel prices. (From Wikipedia)

* [Ruby on Rails][1]
* [CoffeeScript][2]
