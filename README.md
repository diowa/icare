**icare** is an open source [carpooling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool) platform used as a basis for our commercial product [Company Carpool](http://www.companycarpool.com).

Carpooling (also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing, lift-sharing and covoiturage), is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car.
By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person’s travel costs such as fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during high pollution periods and high fuel prices. (From Wikipedia)

**icare** uses the following technologies:

* [Ruby on Rails][1]
* [CoffeeScript][3]
* [Handlebars.js][4] (JavaScript semantic templates)
* [SLIM][5]
* [Twitter Bootstrap][6]
* [Font Awesome][7] (retina ready vectorial icons)
* [Mongoid][8] (ODM for MongoDB)
* [Devise][2]
* Asynchronous tasks with [Resque][9] - Redis
* [RABL][10] API Builder
* Facebook Open Graph / Rest API with [Koala][11]
* Google Maps API
* [RSpec][12]
* [Heroku][14] Cloud Application Platform
* [Multi-Environment configuration][15]
* [Airbrake][16] Exception Notification
* [New Relic][13] Application Performance Management service
