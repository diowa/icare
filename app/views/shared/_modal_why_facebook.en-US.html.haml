          We know that some people do not use Facebook or do not allow permissions to third party applications.

          Anyway, the creation of a new profile will you solve a captcha, wait for an activation email, insert
          personal data, upload at least one picture, select an user name, remember a new password, etc.
          You can skip all this boring process by logging in with Facebook.
        %p
          Personal identity matters for our application. You should be able to trust your new travel companions and Facebook provides
          a first verification through friends, friends of friends...
        %p
          Moreover, through Facebook you can find travel companions who share your same interests.
